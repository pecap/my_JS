                <li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">Don't talk to me about hours, what about sudo, man? How are we gonna get that? You think the meth fairy is gonna just bring it to us?</li>
                <li class="a">It's complicated and I don't wish to discuss it. It's none of your concern. You know what, let's just say that I have a hell of a lot more on my mind, right now, than thinking about buying a damn car wash. Okay? So if you could just... please. </li>
                
                <li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see?</li>
                <li class="a">Look... I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you but once more, I shall try. This fly is a major problem for us. It will ruin our batch. And we need to destroy it and every trace of it, so we can cook. Failing that, we're dead. There's no more room for error. Not with these people. </li>
                
                <li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">Has your condition worsened? Your medical condition, has it grown worse? Is there a ringing in your ears? Are you seeing bright lights or hearing voices? No, clearly you are not. No rational person would do as you have done. Explain yourself. Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child? Where is Pinkman now. </li>
                <li class="a">Got something for me? Is this a five or an S? Jesus, how the hell do you spell street wrong - S T R E A T? Spooge. Not mad dog, not diesel... let me get this straight, you got jacked by a guy named Spooge? </li>
                
                <li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">What's your name? Have a seat, Heisenberg. What is this shit? This is blue. TIGHT! Tight, tight, YEAH! Oh, blue, yellow, pink. Whatever, man. Just keep bringing me that. Alright. Money up front. Sometimes you got to rob to keep your riches, just as long as we got an understanding. </li>
                <li class="a">Hello. Welcome. What a pleasure it is to have you. Just gonna call you Skyler if that's okay. It's a lovely name. It reminds me of the big, beautful sky. Walter always told me how lucky he was, prior to recent unfortunate events. Clearly his taste in women is the same as his taste in lawyers: only the very best with just the right amount of dirty. </li>
                
                <li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">Hello, Walter. You're never gonna pay 'em off, what's the point? The only thing left to do now is leave town, you understand? </li>
                <li class="a">Ding ding ding ding. Ding. Ding, ding ding ding ding. DING DING DING! Ding, ding ding, ding ding DING DING. DING. Ding, ding ding. Ding, ding ding ding. Ding. Ding ding ding ding. Ding, ding - ding ding. DING?! DING DING DING? Ding, ding ding... ding. Ding. DING. DING! </li>
                
                <li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">Any other drugs in the house? Think hard; your freedom depends on it. What about guns, you got any guns in the house? Here's your story - You woke up, you found her, that's all you know. Say it. Say it, please. I woke up I found her that's all I know. Say it. I woke up I found her, that's all I know. Again. Again. Again. </li>
                <li class="a">Well, I guess that's it. Parting thoughts of which I have two. First: as I said I'll handle the legacy costs out of my end so you won't have to worry about my guys anymore. Second: the bug. The DEA will do a sweep can't say when, could be any time. But you need to get it out of there sooner rather than later. Alright. Just get the bug, Walter. </li>
